/*
 * Improv-Serial WiFi Provisioning (from cyd-web-installer/copy-in)
 *
 * Improv-Serial over the CYD's USB bridge, listening on every boot - not only
 * on a fresh device as upstream does. ESP Web Tools uses it two ways:
 *
 *  - After an install it waits up to 10s for Improv and offers "Configure
 *    WiFi", pushing the credentials over USB.
 *  - On Connect it asks for device info within 1.5s. A reply naming this
 *    firmware (PROJECT_NAME) makes it offer "Update" - written without an
 *    erase, so settings survive - instead of "Install" and an erase prompt.
 *    It also offers "Visit device" and "Change WiFi".
 *
 * So the listener must answer from the setup portal loop and from loop(). It
 * costs nothing when no browser is attached; the WiFiManager AP portal runs in
 * parallel on a device with no WiFi.
 *
 * Enabled via IMPROV_SETUP_ENABLED in include/config.h, which must also hold
 * PROJECT_NAME and FIRMWARE_VERSION. IMPROV_DEVICE_PREFIX (optional) names the
 * device in the installer dialog; the MAC's last 4 hex digits are appended.
