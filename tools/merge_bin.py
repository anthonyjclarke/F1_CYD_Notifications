# PlatformIO post-build script. Writes two things to $BUILD_DIR:
#
#  - flash_parts.json: each image PlatformIO flashes and its offset
#    (bootloader, partitions, boot_app0, app). tools/make_manifests.py builds
#    the web installer's manifests from it, so offsets are never hardcoded.
#  - firmware-merged.bin: the same parts as one image flashed at 0x0 - a
#    single-file CLEAN install for `esptool.py write_flash 0x0`.
#
# It ERASES SETTINGS. merge_bin fills the gap between the partition table and
# otadata with 0xFF, and that gap is the NVS partition (0x9000-0xdfff): WiFi,
# settings, touch calibration and the crash report all go. So the web
# installer's manifest does NOT use this file - it lists bootloader,
# partitions, boot_app0 and firmware.bin as separate parts, which leaves NVS
# alone on an update.
#
# boot_app0 is in both on purpose: a device last updated over the air may be
# running from app1, and writing only firmware.bin at 0x10000 leaves otadata
# pointing there, so the old version keeps booting.
#
# Not for the web UI's /update either - that takes firmware.bin. The merged
# image starts with bootloader padding and Update rejects it.
#
# Offsets come from FLASH_EXTRA_IMAGES and ESP32_APP_OFFSET, and flash mode and
# frequency from the builder's own helpers, so the result matches what
# `pio run -t upload` writes. Copy this file into each project's tools/ from
# https://github.com/anthonyjclarke/cyd-web-installer
